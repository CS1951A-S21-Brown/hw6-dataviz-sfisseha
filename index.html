                <h3>Written Response</h3>
                <h5 style="text-align: left"> 1. The first graph answers the question by measuring top 10 video games of all times by level of Global Sales. The bar chart allows us to see the top
                    selling video game worldwide. The second graph shows the breakdown of video game genre for a given region based on the total video game sales of that region. This allows us 
                    to determine which genre of video games is popular in a specific region measured by total sales. When hovering over the pie chart, more information such as total sales for the Genre 
                    and what percent the genre sales account for the total video game sales for the region is displayed. The third graph shows each publisher's speciality or genre focus measured by the number of 
                    video games published within a given genre. This allows us to identify the top publisher of a certain genre of video games by the frequency. An alternative way to determine 
                    top publisher is to use Global Sales as measure. One challenge is that it could be more reflective of the publishers sales distribution and economies of scale rather than their focus on 
                    a certain genre. Thus, if we want to pick a publisher that specialized on a specifc genre of video games, then the graph above would be more apporopriate. However, if we are simply focused on
                    revenue of a publisher based on genre then using sales as a measure would be appropriate.</h5>

                <h5 style="text-align: left">2. D3 is helpful because it binds the data we are trying to dispay to DOM (Document Object Model) elements allowing us to customize and view on the web.
                    It is very helpful for making the data visualizaion component interactive and it can also be used with other JS frameworks such as vue, react and angular.</h5>
                <h5 style="text-align: left">3. D3 may not be the best tool for large number of entries since the DOM manipulation can be slow. D3 may not also be the best tool if we 
                    are working with sensitive information/data that needs to be concealed. D3 doesn't have predetermined visualizations so it may be time consuming to generate D3
                    visulaizations for a simple chart that doesn't require customization.</h5><br/>

                <h4>Accessible Data Visualization</h4>
                <h5 style="text-align: left">4. Based on the second article, I included white space between slices of the pie chart to make it easier to estimate the portion of the slice for people who may be color blind. To view additional information
                on the pie chart, users are required to hover over the chart which maybe inaccessible to inviduals who use assistive technology. I also changed the color of the buttons by checking the color contrast using WAVE(web accessiblity evaluation tool).</h5>
                <h5 style="text-align: left">5. For the pie chart, displaying all of the additional information in a way that is readable without having users hover over the chart was challenging.
                    Reflecting back, it would be more accessible to just display either the genre or percentage or total sales instead of all three.</h5><br/>
